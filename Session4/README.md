##Structured Data
In C++ you have access to something called *Abstract Data Types*, or ADT. ADT group together multiple primitive data types, and are created by the programmer. This may sound similar to a class, but they are different because ADT does not include any function definitions. 

A structured data type can contain other struct data types or arrays. To access the data properities of a struct data array you use dot notation.
