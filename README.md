# Fundamentals Of Computing

##Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions a computer program follows to do something

* Just like a recipe or a set of driving directions
* Most often, there are multiple ways to write a single algorithm
	* Usually there is no single 'best' option best each algorithm will have pros and cons

##Binary
You are use to the decimal (decem is latin for ten) notation, which uses ten numbers 0-9. If you need to represent a number larger than nine, you use a combination of these numbers. 

Let's look at the number **437**

We can write this several ways: </br>
400 + 30 + 7 </br>
4 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 7 *1</br>
4 * **10**<sup>2</sup> + 3 * **10**<sup>1</sup> + 7 * **10**<sup>0</sup>

so

| 4   | 3  | 7    |
| --- |--- | -----|
| 4*10<sup>2</sup>| 3*10<sup>1</sup> | 7*10<sup>0</sup>|

Note that just like we have **10** possible numbers in decimal notation, this is also a base **10** system. 437 has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a one place, which are all base **10**.

*Binary* is similar to decimal notation but instead of 10 numbers (0-9) and base 10, we have 2 (0 & 1) numbers and it is base 2. 

| Binary  | Decimal|       
| ------- |:-------|
| 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 1      |
| 10      | 2      |
| 11      | 3      |
| 100     | 4      |
| 101     | 5      |
| 110     | 6      |
| 111     | 7      |
| 1000    | 8      |

Let's look at the number **101110011** 


| 1   | 0  | 1    | 1   |1    | 0     | 0     | 1 | 1 |
| --- |--- | -----|---  |---- |-----  | ----- |---| ---|
| 1*2<sup>8</sup>| 0*2<sup>7</sup> | 0*2<sup>6</sup>|0*2<sup>5</sup>|1*2<sup>4</sup>| 0*2<sup>3</sup> | 0*2<sup>2</sup>|0*2<sup>1</sup>|0*2<sup>0</sup>

which equals **371**
